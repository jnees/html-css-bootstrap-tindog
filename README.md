# html-css-bootstrap-tindog
Tindog is a practice HTML CSS Bootstrap only webpage. It follows an example project from the Udemy course ["The Complete 2019 Web Developer"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

As this is a practice site for a fictional product, you will find that the download links do not actually take you to a dating app for dogs.
